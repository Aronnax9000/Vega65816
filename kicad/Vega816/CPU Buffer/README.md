# CPU Buffer

The CPU Buffer board provides two straight-wired connectors for the BB816 CPU breakout board, called "the CPU end", and buffers communications between the two of them and dual output connectors with the same pinout, called "the DMA end".

The extra straight wired connectors are included for ease of stacking the boards, both on the CPU end, and on the DMA end, in a multiplexed configuration, to implement shared memory multiprocessing. 

The circuit uses a 74AHCT245 octal bus transceiver for bi-directional communication for the 8 data lines, and seven 74HC541 octal buffers for the remaining signals provided by the BB816 CPU breakout board, including VPA and VDA. One of the buffers is allocated to CPU inputs (NMIB, IRQB, ABORTB, RDY_IN, etc), buffering signals from the DMA end. The remaining 74HC541s buffer lines from the CPU end onto the DMA end.

The bus transceiver and buffers' output enable lines are tied together and provided as an active low input called DMAB, so that a single signal suffices to turn communication on and off. A 1K pulldown resistor ensures that the board is active unless DMAB is raised high by external hardware.
